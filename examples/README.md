# HDF5 Examples

Taken from [the HDF Group](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Examples+from+Learning+the+Basics) examples page.

Compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 with the HDF5 packages installed from anaconda v4.8.3.   It was necessary to run `conda install gxx_linux-64` to install the compiler toolchains which support the `h5cc` wrapper script.
